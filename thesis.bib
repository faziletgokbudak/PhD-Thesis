abstract = {Authoring high-quality digital materials is key to realism in 3D rendering. Previous generative models for materials have been trained exclusively on synthetic data; such data is limited in availability and has a visual gap to real materials. We circumvent this limitation by proposing PhotoMat: the first material generator trained exclusively on real photos of material samples captured using a cell phone camera with flash. Supervision on individual material maps is not available in this setting. Instead, we train a generator for a neural material representation that is rendered with a learned relighting module to create arbitrarily lit RGB images; these are compared against real photos using a discriminator. We train PhotoMat with a new dataset of 12,000 material photos captured with handheld phone cameras under flash lighting. We demonstrate that our generated materials have better visual quality than previous material generators trained on synthetic data. Moreover, we can fit analytical material models to closely match these generated neural materials, thus allowing for further editing and use in 3D rendering.},

abstract = {We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality dataset of human faces.},

abstract = "Image manipulation takes many forms. A powerful approach involves image adjustment by example. To make color edits more intuitive, the intelligent transfer of a user-specified target image's color palette can achieve a multitude of creative effects, provided the user is supplied with a small set of straightforward parameters. We present a novel histogram reshaping technique which allows significantly better control than previous methods and transfers the color palette between images of arbitrary dynamic range. We achieve this by manipulating histograms at different scales, which allows coarse and fine features to be considered separately. We compare our approach to a number of existing color transfer and tonemapping techniques and demonstrate its performance for a wide range of images. "

                texture that is tailored to the user's needs.  In this state-of-the-art report,
                we aim to achieve three goals: (1) provide a tutorial that is easy to follow for
                readers who are not already familiar with the subject, (2) make a comprehensive
                survey and comparisons of different methods, and (3) sketch a vision for future
                work that can help motivate and guide readers that are interested in texture
                synthesis research.  We cover fundamental algorithms as well as extensions and

abstract = {Photo retouching enables photographers to invoke dramatic visual impressions by artistically enhancing their photos through stylistic color and tone adjustments. However, it is also a time-consuming and challenging task that requires advanced skills beyond the abilities of casual photographers. Using an automated algorithm is an appealing alternative to manual work, but such an algorithm faces many hurdles. Many photographic styles rely on subtle adjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further, these adjustments are often spatially varying. Existing automatic algorithms are still limited and cover only a subset of these challenges. Recently, deep learning has shown unique abilities to address hard problems. This motivated us to explore the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the context of photo editing. In this article, we formulate automatic photo adjustment in a manner suitable for this approach. We also introduce an image descriptor accounting for the local semantics of an image. Our experiments demonstrate that training DNNs using these descriptors successfully capture sophisticated photographic styles. In particular and unlike previous techniques, it can model local adjustments that depend on image semantics. We show that this yields results that are qualitatively and quantitatively better than previous work.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Localized Makeup Transfer Network to automatically recommend the most suitable makeup for a female and synthesis the makeup on her face. Given a before-makeup face, her most suitable makeup is determined automatically. Then, both the before-makeup and the reference faces are fed into the proposed Deep Transfer Network to generate the after-makeup face. Our end-to-end makeup transfer network have several nice properties including: (1) with complete functions: including foundation, lip gloss, and eye shadow transfer; (2) cosmetic specific: different cosmetics are transferred in different manners; (3) localized: different cosmetics are applied on different facial regions; (4) producing naturally looking results without obvious artifacts; (5) controllable makeup lightness: various results from light makeup to heavy makeup can be generated. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our network performs much better than the methods of [Guo and Sim, 2009] and two variants of NerualStyle [Gatys et al. , 2015a].},

abstract = {We propose a new technique for visual attribute transfer across images that may have very different appearance but have perceptually similar semantic structure. By visual attribute transfer, we mean transfer of visual information (such as color, tone, texture, and style) from one image to another. For example, one image could be that of a painting or a sketch while the other is a photo of a real scene, and both depict the same type of scene.Our technique finds semantically-meaningful dense correspondences between two input images. To accomplish this, it adapts the notion of "image analogy" [Hertzmann et al. 2001] with features extracted from a Deep Convolutional Neutral Network for matching; we call our technique deep image analogy. A coarse-to-fine strategy is used to compute the nearest-neighbor field for generating the results. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in a variety of cases, including style/texture transfer, color/style swap, sketch/painting to photo, and time lapse.},

abstract = {We present an intuitive and efficient method for editing the appearance of complex spatially-varying datasets, such as images and measured materials. In our framework, users specify rough adjustments that are refined interactively by enforcing the policy that similar edits are applied to spatially-close regions of similar appearance. Rather than proposing a specific user interface, our method allows artists to quickly and imprecisely specify the initial edits with any method or workflow they feel most comfortable with. An energy optimization formulation is used to propagate the initial rough adjustments to the final refined ones by enforcing the editing policy over all pairs of points in the dataset. We show that this formulation is equivalent to solving a large linear system defined by a dense matrix. We derive an approximate algorithm to compute such a solution interactively by taking advantage of the inherent structure of the matrix. We demonstrate our approach by editing images, HDR radiance maps, and measured materials. Finally, we show that our framework generalizes prior methods while providing significant improvements in generality, robustness and efficiency.},
