\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

I presented a hypernetwork model for neural BRDF representation, which is suitable for point-based BRDF acquisition setups. Representing the discrete BRDF values of a material as a continuous generalizable neural field, HyperBRDF offers (1) accurate reconstructions of unseen materials from a sparse set of samples and (2) compression of the highly densed BRDF values into compact latent representations. 

Thanks to the set encoder that enables an arbitrary number of input samples and the neural field, hyponet, that offers the nonlinear built-in interpolation, I showed that the hypernetwork model can capture the BRDFs of test materials better than the baselines. I also illustrated our model's compression capacity on the entire MERL dataset, showing consistent results across varying materials.
